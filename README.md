# Installation

## Prerequisites (Java)

Before installing the TPL interpreter, ensure you have **Java 8 or above** installed on your system. TPL relies on Java to execute code.

### Verifying Java Installation

- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Type `java -version` and press Enter.

If Java is installed correctly, you should see the installed Java version displayed. If not, you'll need to download and install Java from the [official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).
<br>Now that you have verified (or installed) Java, you can proceed with the TPL interpreter installation.

## Installing Interpreter

This guide outlines the installation process for the TPL scripting language. Here, we'll cover two options:

1. Using the TPL VS Code Extension (Recommended)
2. Traditional Command-Line Installation

## Downloading the TPL Interpreter

Before diving into either installation method, you'll need to download the TPL interpreter. Head over to the release section: [TPL Releases](https://github.com/Tanish-Ranjan/TPL/releases)

- Locate the latest version (as of now, [v0.1.0-beta03](https://github.com/Tanish-Ranjan/TPL/releases/tag/v0.1.0-beta03)).
- Download the interpreter available as a JAR file.

### 1\. Using the TPL VS Code Extension (Recommended)

For a convenient and integrated development environment, we recommend using the TPL VS Code extension. It allows you to work with TPL scripts directly within VS Code. To install it:

- Open VS Code.
- Navigate to the Extensions tab (Ctrl+Shift+X on Windows/Linux, Cmd+Shift+X on macOS).
- Search for "TPL Extension".
- Locate the extension developed by "Tanish Ranjan".
- Click Install.
Once installed, the extension will automatically configure VS Code for TPL development. Refer to the [extension's installation guide](https://github.com/Tanish-Ranjan/TPL-VSC-Extension#installation) for further details and setup instructions.

### 2\. Traditional Command-Line Installation

For those who prefer the command line, follow these steps:
  
- Save the downloaded JAR: Save the downloaded interpreter file (e.g., `tpl_interpreter.jar`) to a desired location on your system.

- Create a TPL script file: Use a text editor to create a file with a `.tpl` extension (e.g., `myscript.tpl`). Write your TPL code in this file.

- Run the TPL interpreter: Open a terminal or command prompt. Run the following command:
  ``` bash
  java -jar <path-to-downloaded-interpreter> <path-to-your-tpl-file>
  ```
  Replace `<path-to-downloaded-interpreter>` with the actual path to the extracted TPL interpreter file (e.g., `tpl_interpreter.jar`), and `<path-to-your-tpl-file>` with the path to your TPL script (e.g., `myscript.tpl`).
