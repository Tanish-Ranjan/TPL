# TPL (The Professional's Langugage)
TPL, short for The Professional's Language, is a modern, multi-paradigm programming language that combines the simplicity of high-level languages with the power of low-level languages. TPL is dynamically typed, memory safe, and garbage collected, making it robust choice for a variety of applications.

TPL supports multi-threading, allowing for efficient utilization of comutational resources. It also provides a unique feature of executing Kotlin code blocks within the language, offering greater flexibility and control to the programmer.

With its simple syntax and powerful features, TPL is designed to be easy to learn and use, while also providing the tools nescessary for serious software development. It can be used for everything from simple tasks to complex system programming.

TPL also offers a unique plugin system that allows users to alter the behaviour of the compiler, tailoring the language to their specific needs. This makes TPL not just a programming lanugage, but a customizable tool for coding.

Whether you're a beginner looking to dive into the world of programming, or an experienced developer seeking a versatile and powerful new language, TPL has something to offer. Welcome to the future of programming with TPL!

# Installation Guide for TPL
### Step 1: Download the TPL Interpreter
First, navigate to the **Releases** section of the TPL GitHub repository. Here, you’ll find different versions of the TPL interpreter. Download the version that suits your needs. Remember the location where you save the downloaded file, as you’ll need this information later.
### Step 2: Check Your Java Installation
The TPL interpreter requires Java 8 or higher to run. To check if you have the correct version of Java installed, open a command prompt or terminal window and type `java -version`. If the version number displayed is 8 or higher, you’re good to go. If not, you’ll need to download and install the appropriate version of Java.
### Step 3: Create a TPL Script File
Next, create a new file with a `.tpl` extension. This will be your TPL script file. Open this file in a text editor of your choice and paste your TPL program code into it. Save the file and remember its location for the next step.
### Run Your TPL Script
Finally, it’s time to run your TPL script. Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory containing your TPL script file. Then, run the following command:
```
java -jar <path to tpl interpreter> <path to tpl script>
```
Replace `<path to tpl interpreter>` with the complete path to the TPL interpreter you downloaded in Step 1. Similarly, replace `<path to tpl script>` with the complete path to the TPL script file you created in Step 3.

And that’s it! Your TPL script should now run successfully. If you encounter any issues, make sure to check your paths and Java installation.
