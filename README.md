# TPL (The Professional's Langugage)

It is modern programming language like Python and Kotlin. My main purpose for developing it was to add the features that I nescessarily need in a programming language to boost progress in developing applications. I found out that I waste a lot of time everyday writing kind of the same boilerplate code and so TPL - The Professional's Language offers a whole bunch of abbreviations for you to use as you get more and more familiar with the language. But it doesn't stop there. I like to customize things a lot and so do many people, everyone has their own taste and likings. So the key feature of this language is the customizable interpreter. Every programmer gets an option to customize the behavior of the interpreter for a program they write. Isn't that crazy??

*Unfortunately it is still under development and without keeping you all under the shadow - TPL's first version won't be available atleast before the December 2023.
It will be open source and would be available in this repository for you all to check out with it's first release.*
